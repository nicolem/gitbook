# Sales Dashboard

picture 4 The sales dashboard summarizes your numbers for different products.

The columns for each agent are as follows:

**CURRENT WEEK WRITTEN DECIDED** includes the opportunities in the written decided stage for the current week. Annuity, AUM, and Private Placement policies show up here. Contributions also show up here while they are being processed. Note, the value of a Private Placement policy displayed is one third of the sale value. This is done to equivocate the commission received from these policies with the standard of Annuity policies.

**ALL TIME APP ONLY** shows all your opportunities in the App Only stage; this stage precedes the written decided stage. Your goal is to clear out this column and work the leads into written decided.

**ROLLING YEAR WRITTEN DECIDED** is the same as Current Week Written Decided, just with opportunities over the rolling year. This helps you monitor applications that have been sitting long in the transfer process.

**THIS YEAR ANNUITY PRODUCTION** lists the closed Annuity policies for the calendar year. 

**THIS YEAR LIFE PRODUCTION** lists the closed Life Insurance policies for the calendar year. 

**THIS YEAR PRIVATE PRODUCTION** lists all closed Private Placement policies.

**ALL TIME AUM PRODUCTION** lists all closed AUM policies.

**GOAL **is a percentage** **value of the Current Week Written Decided divided by the Agent’s Goal, set in their profile.
