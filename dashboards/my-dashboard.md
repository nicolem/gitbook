# My Dashboard

This dashboard looks different depending on the user.

The standard view includes two panels. On the left is a short listing of upcoming events in the next week. It lists the date, location, and agent in a clickable listing. The right panel has the messaging center, which is also visible from the dropdown of the mail icon from the header. This is currently used to send out updates on the CRM features. You can also send messages to other users in the CRM.

If a User is marked responsible for a transfer, their My Dashboard will have a Current Transfers panel on the left. This view will also be visible for the manager of someone doing transfers, so they can keep track of progress. Each opportunity is visible here; notes can be made from the dashboard without going into the Buying Unit individually. The event and message panels are moved to the right side of the dashboard.

A user with assigned calls will have those calls displayed on their My Dashboard Page the day they are scheduled. From here they can add notes and schedule another call. When the call is complete, click the “Mark Called” button. Uncomplete calls will be automatically rescheduled to the next day until they are marked as complete.
