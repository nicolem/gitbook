# Households

## Searching

You can find a household by searching by name \(first, last, full, nickname\), phone number, and policy number.

## Bulk Household Import through CSV

You can import households from a CSV file. Use the “Upload CSV” Button on the household search page. The pop up has a template you can download to use for your households. You can rearrange columns in the template, but do not rename them. For the event columns, the date and location must match the Event data in the CRM exactly.

## Adding Households Individually

Use the “Create new Lead” button to go to the new household form. This process is more time consuming than a standard import, but will need to be done when someone has requested to be added to the Do Not Mail List. The form is self-explanatory. An Event must be selected to continue with the policy selling process.

## Display

picture 8 Household view with expanded sidebar

There are four main areas on the household view.

### Section 1: Contact Information

This section lists the Primary and Secondary Contacts, and their individual email addresses and phone numbers. If a nickname is entered, that will replace their first name for reports and other displays in the system. If a contact is marked deceased they will not show up on exported reports for mailing purposes.

Below is the Household information with main phone number and up to two mailing addresses

picture 10 Call History Pop Up Form

The last part is a button for a Call History pop-up. You can schedule calls in this pop-up or while entering notes. Scheduled calls show up on the “My Dashboard” page the day they are due and reschedule for the next day until marked complete.

### Section 2: Office Information

This section has information on the household as a whole. The zone is automatically assigned based on the zip code of their main address. You can also manually assign a zone if they fall outside your defined areas. It’s important to track their interested products for future campaigns. Tags are also important to track who is on your Do Not Mail list. The personal notes section is useful for remembering small things about your client and their family.

The different household statuses are described below:  
LEAD is a Buying Unit with no Opportunities entered.  
POTENTIAL is a Buying Unit with an Opportunity entered.  
ACTIVE CLIENTS have at least one written decided/issued policy.   
INACTIVE CLIENTS have only surrendered policies entered.

### Section 3: Sale Pipeline Tabs

#### Events Tab

This is where you add Event Attendance to a Household.

#### Opportunities Tab

The Listing gives you an overview on basic information about the policy.

The notes and Transfers Sections drop down when you click on the buttons that say “\# notes” or “\# transfers”.

The NOTE FIELD is auto filled with the policy number to help you track notes later. The Notes section also have buttons to drop down the tags select and set a follow-up call.

The TRANSFERS SECTION allows you to track incoming accounts for the new policy. Set the source and amount. The check boxes are there to track the transfer progress.

You track TRANSFER STEPS for the opportunity in a modal that pops up. In the screenshot above, you access the pop up by clicking on the current transfer step, “Scrub and submit application...”, in gray.

The pop up displays the transfer step history; each step’s due and completion dates. The person handling the transfer will see the progress on their My Dashboard. Their Supervisor/Manager, set on the user’s profile, will also see the transfer progress on their My Dashboard. The Transfers are sorted by earliest due. They are also color coded so past due events are at the top of the queue in red.

#### Policies Tab

To convert an opportunity to a policy, use the trophy icon and fill in the correct fields.

picture 17 Policy view in Policy Tab

The policy view is very similar to the opportunity view. The notes section works the same way, with the policy number automatically added to the beginning of the notes field. It carries over transfers and their notes from the opportunity. When adding a contribution or withdrawal to an issued policy, use the “Show on Dashboard” checkbox so it shows up on your My Dashboard page to track progress.

#### Documents Tab

The Documents Tab provides a place to store files related to the household. Use the “Attach new document” Button to upload a file to the household. You can embed a box folder on the client by pasting the share link into the “Embed Box Folder” option. You must login to see the box files, and only people with the right permissions can view these files.

There are also the options to generate and import an annual review. The import pop up has a template you can download. The CRM will create transfers that line up with the values found on each policy in the file selected. The generate option will create an annual review and place it in the documents tab.

### Section 4: Notes Sidebar

The right sidebar displays all the notes for the household. Notes are sorted by most recent and include who wrote the note. The icon by the note describes where the note was made. House icons are from notes made on the sidebar, for the whole household. Trophy icons are for opportunity notes. Bank icons are for transfers. Umbrellas are for policies. Phone icons are for call notes. Notes can also be tagged by expanding the tags section under the note box. There is also a search icon that allows you to search for notes by their tags. As previously mentioned, you can schedule a follow-up call from the note section. These calls will show up on your dashboard the date scheduled, and will display in the call history available through section 1 of the household.
